{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2} {cmd:gencrm} is a user-written command that fits generalized continuation ratio models (Fullerton and Xu 2016). This class of models permits three types of covariates: (1) covariates whose coefficients are constrained to be equal across cutpoint equations, (2) covariates whose coefficients vary across cutpoint equations by a common factor (listed using the prop option), and (3) covariates whose coefficients freely vary across cutpoint equations (listed using the free option). 

{p 4 4 2} {cmd:gencrm} supports factor variables and the {cmdab:mi estimate} prefix. Note that the command is not currently integrated with Stata's {cmdab:predict} or {cmdab:margins} commands. Because of this, the command also is not integrated with Stata's {cmdab:svy} suite of commands, though it is possible to incorporate weights.


{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2} {cmdab:fa:ctor(}{it:varlist}{cmd:)} specifies which, if any, of the independent variables have coefficients that vary across cutpoint equations by a common factor (i.e., proportionality constraint)

{p 4 8 2} {cmdab:fr:ee(}{it:varlist}{cmd:)} specifies which, if any, of the independent variables have coefficients that freely vary across cutpoint equations.

{p 4 8 2} {cmdab:link(}{it:string}{cmd:)} specifies the link function to be used. The default link function is the logit link. Users may also specify a probit or a cloglog link.

{p 4 8 2} {cmdab:vce(}{it:vcetype}{cmd:)} specifies the type of standard error reported. Users may specify {cmdab:r:obust} or {cmdab:cl:uster} {it:clustvar} standard errors. 

{p 4 8 2} {cmdab:or} report odds ratios

{p 4 8 2} {cmdab:ef:orm} report exponentiated coefficients


{title:Examples}
{p 4 4 2}
The following example draws on a Stata dataset with information about birthweight to illustrate a few variants of generalized continuation ratio models. Note that this is not a particularly good substantive example as birthweight is not an outcome that we typically think of as progressing through a series of stages. Nonetheless, it is useful to illustrate the {cmdab:gencrm} command.
